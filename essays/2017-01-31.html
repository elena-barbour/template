One of the most essential skills of a programmer is their ability to write documentation. This is strongly connected to the idea that someone isn't an expert in a skill until they are able to teach it, in the same way a programmer can increase his or her value by refining their skill in documenation.

<h3> Some advice to programmers</h3>
<p>After reading the article by Raymond, I have some highlights that might be useful! Especially to those that are just starting out on programming.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>1. Don't ask homework questions!</strong></dt>
  <dd>"Hackers" can see, nay<i> smell </i>a homework question from a hundred miles away. You will either be ignored, act as the last straw for some hackers, or be the sacrificial lamb; an example to the rest of the world so they might see what happens to those who don't respect the process and have the audacity to seek unmerited help from people who have most likely taken the same classes and actually figured those same problems out<i> by themselves</i>.</dd>
  <dd>The best thing to do when you have a question about homework is google it. I assure you, the answer will be there.</dd>
  <dt><strong>2. Do not label your questions as "urgent"</strong></dt>
  <dd>It's only urgent for you, and it will not draw a hacker to a problem if all it says is "URGENT!! segmentation fault file won't compile!!"</dd>
  <dd>This, for one, is not giving any insight into what common problem this could be related to, and is a common enough question that it doesn't quite make sense why you didn't spend 5 minutes searching for the answer.</dd>
  <dt><strong>3. 'Please' and 'Thank' You are sometimes <i>actual</i> magic words</strong></dt>
  <dd>There's nothing better than being a polite programmer, and especially on the internet when facial expressions are not present, we all need to make a conscious effort to be kind to those helping us. Maybe it will even be the difference between getting helped or getting passed by.</dd>
