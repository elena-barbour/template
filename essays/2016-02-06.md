<img class="ui tiny right spaced image" src="../images/degree_difficulty.jpg">*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

As a newcomer to Javascript, but not a newcomer to coding, I've realized that nothing compares to your first language. It sounds nostalgic and I haven't met enough programmers to know if I'm "behind the tide" for thinking this, but I will always love C. And I can mostly compare and contrast between Javascript and C (of which I think Javascript is more exciting and less restrictive than C) by how I view ICS students and Computer Engineering students.

ICS students have this essence of fantasy and mystique associated with them, where anything is possible (like working for Google, Apple, or Microsoft) and anything can be programmed to look beautiful. In Computer Engineering, we couldn't care less about how it looks, which is what I like most about it since I'm not much of a visual artist or enthusiast myself. We ask two questions: Does it work? Yes? Great. Does it work at optimum efficiency? No? Get back to work.

A great reference to Computer Engineers and their user interface woes can be explained from an episode in HBO's Silicon Valley where a computer engineer's app (with the best compression algorithm known to man) was not met with rave reviews


I'm worried about Javascript, but I'm excited simultaneously.

## Reason 1: I like rules

The reason I can't resist comparing these two languages is because I beleive they are actually quite similar, but Javascript -let's face it- is freedom wrapped in a little binary bow. And that's exactly what I can't stand about it.

## Reason 2: I like my code where it belongs: in the dungeons of my unix terminal.

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## Reason 3: It's my second language.

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Conclusion

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
