Project Imua is a multi-community college collaboration involving Kapi'olani, Kaua'i, Honolulu, and Windward Community College. Our goal was to succesfully design a space-ready scientific payload that is able to pass all criteria set by the Colorado Space Grant Consortium in partnership with RockSat-X and Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. In Project Imua Year 1, our scientific payload, PIP (Project Imua Payload), is a UV Spectrometer designed to measure UV-variations emitted from the sun paired with a light-sensor array designed to record the orientation of the payload during flight.

I was a part of the Windward Community College team, which was responsible for integration and testing of the payload. This involved integration of all subsystems, electrical systems, and mechanical systems. I was a part of a three student subteam tasked with designing an Arduino Uno to measure and record the acceleration our payload experiences during testing. I wrote a program in C that constantly grabbed the data that the accelerometer was reading and inputing into the Arduino unit and wrote into a text file. I also acted as Team Lead in the second half of the project and acted as the point of contact between our campus and the other campuses.
